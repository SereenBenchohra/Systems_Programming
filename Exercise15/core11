This test creates an empty hash table and then verifies the following:
   
   The capacity of the hash table is as expected (unchanged from creation).
   The number of unique entries in the hash table is 0.
   The number of total entries in the hash table is 0.

Note: The htDestroy function is called after the primary test to free all
   dynamically allocated memory so that Valgrind may be used to verify that
   there are no memory leaks.
