This is a variation of test01 but with different inputs (seed, maximum
letter, number of board positions, and number of guesses). Like test01 it
plays Mastermind with all valid inputs but without guessing the right 
answer within the specified number of guesses. The focus is to test a wide
variety of exact and inexact combinations.
