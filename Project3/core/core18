Creates a hash table containing several elements and then calls htLookUp
and verifies the following:

   Each element is found in the list.
   The element returned is a shallow copy of the original. 
   Each element has the correct frequency.

Note: The htDestroy function is called after the primary test to free all
   dynamically allocated memory so that Valgrind may be used to verify that
   there are no memory leaks.
