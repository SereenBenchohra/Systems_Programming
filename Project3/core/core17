Creates a hash table containing several elements and then calls htLookUp
with something that is NOT in the hash table and verifies the following:

   The data field of the returned HTEntry is NULL.
   The frequency field of the returned HTEntry is 0.

Note: The htDestroy function is called after the primary test to free all
   dynamically allocated memory so that Valgrind may be used to verify that
   there are no memory leaks.
