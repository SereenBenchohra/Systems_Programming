Creates a hash table containing duplicate entries. The duplicates compare
as equal BUT ARE DIFFERENT memory objects. The test then calls htLookUp
on the duplicate data and verifies the following:

   That the element is found in the list.
   The element returned is a shallow copy of the FIRST entry added. 
   Each element has the correct frequency.

Note: The htDestroy function is called after the primary test to free all
   dynamically allocated memory so that Valgrind may be used to verify that
   there are no memory leaks.
