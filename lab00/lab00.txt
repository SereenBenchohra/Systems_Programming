      Goals and Expectations for CPE357

      My goals and Expectations for CPE357 is to learn about how the 
   Operating System interacts and functions with other parts of the
   Computer. In addition, as a prospective Computer Engineer, I am 
   interested on learning how  the Hardware in Systems Programming
   is utilized and managed and increase Hardware awareness. Also, I 
   would like to be more an efficient programmer.

      Policy on Cheating 

   It is never acceptable to allow someone else to have your work for
   reference or to refer to someone elses work while writing your own.


   Cheating requires an F course grade.


      Pledge on Cheating 

   I will do my own work in this class. That is, unless it is explicitly 
   permitted by the assignment, I will neither use others work as my own 
   nor make my work available for others to use. I understand that either 
   of these actions constitutes cheating sufficient to merit a grade of F
   for the course.


      I agree.
