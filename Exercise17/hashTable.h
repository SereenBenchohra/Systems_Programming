 *
 *    FNCompare: Compares two data items to determine data1 is less-than,
 *       equal-to, or greater than data2. The function returns a negative,
 *       zero, or positive value, respectively.
 *
 *    FNDestroy: May be NULL. This function must be provided (not NULL) when
 *       the data being stored in the hash table, itself, has additional
 *       dynamically allocated memory (sub-allocations) that only the owner of
 *       the data knows about and can free, otherwise it should be NULL. When
 *       provided, this function frees all such sub-allocations BUT does NOT
 *       free the primary data itself as that is done by htDestroy. This
 *       division of labor avoids the error that occurs if free is called more
 *       than once on the same memory allocation.

/* Description: Creates a new hash table as specified.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   1. The function asserts (man 3 assert) if numSizes is not 1 or more.
 *   2. The function asserts (man 3 assert) if any of the sizes are not
 *      greater than the immediately preceding size.
 *   3. The function asserts (man 3 assert) If the load factor is not greater
 *      than 0.0 and less than or equal to 1.0.
 *   4. You must make a deep copy of the _functions_ pointers and _sizes_
 *      array since you don't know where the caller allocated them - they
 *      could be on the stack and you don't want to point there - that's a
 *      potential and likely _unlucky bug_ waiting to happen!
 *
 * Parameters:
 *    functions: A structure of function pointers to the data-specific
 *       functions required by the hash table.
 *    sizes: An array of hash table sizes. Must always be at least one size
 *       greater than zero specified, more if rehashing is desired. Prime
 *       numbers are best but not required/checked for. That being said, you
 *       should use prime numbers!
 *    numSizes: The number of values in the sizes array.
 *    rehashLoadFactor: The load factor to rehash at. Should be a value greater
 *       than 0.0 and less than or equal to 1.0. A value of 1.0 means
 *       "do not rehash".
 *
 * Return: A pointer to an anonymous (file-local) structure representing a
 *         hash table.

void htDestroy(void *hashTable);

/* Description: Adds a shallow copy of the data to the hash table. The data
 *    being added MUST BE dynamically allocated because it will be freed
 *    when the hash table is destroyed!
 * 
 * Notes:
 *    1. The function is expected to have O(1) performance.
 *    2. The function asserts (man 3 assert) if data is NULL. 
 *    3. The function rehashes to the next size when:
 *          1. The rehash load factor is NOT 1.0, a value of 1.0 indicates
 *             rehashing is not desired.
 *          2. And there is a next size. Otherwise continue with the current
 *             size.
 *          3. And the ratio of unique entries TO the current hash table size
 *             (BEFORE adding the new data) exceeds the rehash load factor.
 *    4. When the data being added is a duplicate, the original entry is kept
 *       in the hash table AND the caller is responsible for freeing the
 *       duplicate.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *    hashTable: A pointer returned by htCreate.
 *    data: The data to add.
 *
 * Return: The frequency of the data in the hash table. A value of 1 means it
 *    is a new and unique entry, values greater than 1 mean it is a duplicate
 *    with the indicated frequency.

 *       memory is still in use by the hash table! To free the data call
 *       htDestroy when you are completely done with the hash table AND all
 *       arrays returned by this function.
 * 
 * Parameters:

 *       during actual use of the hash table it DOES NOT need to have O(1)
 *       performance. FYI: O(N) performance is expected.
 *    2. The number of chains is a count of the non-empty chains in the
 *       hash table.
 *    3. The maximum chain length is the length of the longest chain in the
 *       hash table.
 *    4. The average chain length is the sum of the length of all chains
 *       in the hash table divided by the number of non-zero length chains.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *    hashTable: A pointer returned by htCreate.
 *
 * Return: An HTMetric struct with the current metrics for the specified hash
 *    table.
