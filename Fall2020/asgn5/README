The program will raise an error if it finds the limits to be violated.

To Build the program, run make which compiles all the files, "parseline.c", 
and "getInfo.c" where the object files are created. Once the program is built,
you have to run it with the command "./parseline". A prompt will enter with 
"line:" wherer you enter argmuments in your simulated command line. 

When the arguments are entered, the program will parse the command into stages,
separated by pipes. In each stage, the program will analyze the parsed command
and display the input, output, argc, and the argv. 

In the parsed line for Input, the displaydepends on what is given in the 
arguments.If there is a  input redirection , "<", then the program will display
the input file that redirection refers to ( An error is raised if there are 
multiple redirections). If the input is received in the pipe, then the program 
will let you know. Otherwise it is from stdin.

Likewise for Output display also depends on the arguments. In the arguments if
there is a " >", then the program will display the output file that it has been 
redirected to. If the output is through a pipe, it is sent to the next stage 
and the prompt will let you know (error if found multiple of the same 
redirection).

NOTE: I used Lab02 solution instead of minefor this project. Also did not 
complete to have it testable for every test.
