 - To compile the program, enter the command "gcc -Wall main.c" in the terminal

 - To run the program enter "./a.out" in the terminal

1.  Machine : unix5.csc.calpoly.edu
2.  Aside from the intro page I manned for printf
    and give useful information how to use printf

3.  For this program I used the vim editor since 
    it is a convenient editor to sign in the CSL 
    servers when I am on the terminal


4.  My program is supposed to run a C program that 
    prints ""Hello World"". Thankfully, I did not 
    encounter any issues with the program and it 
    ran smoothly.
