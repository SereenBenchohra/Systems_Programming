# Questions for Lab02

1. a) char *cp;
   b) char *ap[];
   c) int **p;

2. Yes you can but then  once you make it point to itself it becomes another pointer, an extra pointer.

3. The fundamental problem with this code is in within the for loop statement, "p != '\0'", which is a 
   problem since it is looking for the '\0' within an actual address rather than the contents of a string.
   As a result, this will result in an infinite loop that dumps a bunch of content that will eventually
   cause a segmentation fault. In order to fix this, we need to access the contents of the pointer, so
   we need to deference p to work with the new statement being "*p != '\0'".

4. a)  This statements is correct in some ways because both array and pointers access memory.

   b)  That statement is not entirely true because pointers  can take different 
       addresses as value but an array cannot change. An array always  points to the first element of an
       array and you cannot change what an array points to.


5. Perror needs to have a const parameter because the the argument to perror is a pointer. As a result,
   this  could change or corrupt the string that it points to. So, const prevents that from happenning.
   But the argument in strerror is not a pointer and is pass by value, so there is not a concern for any
   corruption or change in data even if attempted to.


6. The year in which it will overflow is 2038. We can extend the overflow point by updating time_t to a 
   64-bit integer. Applications have to recompile and updated  to the new 64- bit integer.

7. size_t is an unsigned integer data type, which give a a value greater than or equal to 0. It is located 
   in the stdlib.h.


#Uniq Program Status: Partially Completed

The read long line functions as intended however there are errors when
implementing the uniq function ( it just outputs whats read in instead of
reading the next line to compare ). The program is intended to read the current
line, and as it reads the next line to current line, the previous line is then
compared to the current, if they are the same, dont print out the current, other
 wise print it out . What it actually does it prints our the same line and end
 after a newline.

 (Instructions on how to run the current program )
 To build the program, you would run "make" in the terminal
 To run it, in the terminal, you would run "./a.out"
 Then you would write to stdin like "hello" and press enter
 and then what is read is printed out and the program ends.
